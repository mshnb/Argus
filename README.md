# Argus

## Introduction
Argus Panoptes, byname Panoptes(Greek:"All-Seeing"), is a many-eyed giant in Greek mythology.  His byname derives from the hundred eyes in his head or all over his body.  
Argus was appointed by the goddess Hera to watch the cow into which Io (Heraâ€™s priestess) had been transformed, but he was slain by Hermes in the Homeric poems. To praise his loyalty, Argus's eyes were transferred by Hera to the tail of the peacock. 

I named my scanline z-buffer renderer "Argus" because it's scanlines can capture every pixel's depth fast and accurately just as Argus's eyes.
